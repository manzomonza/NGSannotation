# NGSannotation
The aim of NGSannotation is to automate simple variant annotation steps of ThermoFisher IonReporter/Genexus generated variant reports. The tool is specifically developed to work in a hybrid system of manual curation and automated information retrieval. It furthermore generates dynamic plain text chunks which expedite variant interpretation and reporting.
